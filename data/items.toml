description = "Savage and Cooke is a restoration of two 200-year old warehouses into a modern American Distillery. The project takes advantage of the history of the building, turning a secure vault into a tasting room, and putting the wood structure on display with the rest of the building. Building 45 of Savage and Cooke, which contains the tasting rooms and barrel storage, won the WoodWorks 2019 national award for Durable and Adaptable Wood Structures. https://www.woodworks.org/project/savage-cooke-distillery-mare-island-building-45"

description = "The Livermore Electric Safety Academy was a renovation to a 42 acre campus for PG&E to train electrical lineman. The project featured updates to all 7 existing buildings on the campus, as well as the addition of 2 new training facilities, and oversight for the construction of a substation. The renovation to the main building on the campus features a large glass floor,  creating transparency between the office spaces upstairs and the cafeteria space down below. Natural light trickles down between the two floors, creating an inviting space for workers to gather."

The project is primarily an exercise at space planning that will eventually grow into a large renovation."

My goal was to explore the purpose of architecture, which was originally intended to make the world grander, and has since been reduced to the simple development of details that copy the world as it is."
